We are a data science lab with interests in complex systems modeling, ranging from the very small (microbiome) to the very large (biosphere). Our active work is concentrated in two application areas: sustainability data science and the microbiome. In sustainability, we are developing computational methods that support the long-term sustainability of human civilization on Earth. Broadly, we are interested in using data mining to identify what changes are needed to make civilization more sustainable, and sharing that information in ways that empower people and organizations to change their behavior. In microbiome research, we are developing methods for analyzing microbiome data, and applying those methods in clinical studies to better diagnose and predict disease. See example projects [here](/projects).
