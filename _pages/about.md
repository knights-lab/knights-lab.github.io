My data science lab has been heavily involved in microbiome research. We have developed methods for analyzing microbiome data, and we have applied those methods in clinical studies to better diagnose and predict disease. We have also been involved in several data science projects related to sustainability. See example projects [here](/projects).

For prospective students: please note that I am not currently accepting any new students to the lab.
